# Study Repository

This repository contains files and scripts for study purposes, primarily focused on topics related to cybersecurity, networking, and Python programming. These files are intended to assist with learning, experimenting, and building foundational knowledge in various technical areas.

## 📚 Book Reference

The scripts and examples in this repository were heavily inspired by the book:

**Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters (2nd Edition)**

By Justin Seitz

I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning Python for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity. It provides practical examples and teaches how to use Python to build security tools, automate tasks, and manipulate networks and protocols.

## 📝 Comments

I've added plenty of comments throughout the code to ensure that it is as clear and understandable as possible. I strongly encourage you to read these comments for a better understanding of each script's functionality. 

If you encounter any difficulties or would like to go deeper into the topics, I highly recommend reading the referenced book, as it dives deeper into each of the concepts covered here.

## 📂 Repository Contents
